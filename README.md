# Sentiment analysis of well known biological research groups and organizations

This is the final project for a seminar about R at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

## Goal

Examine the sentiment polarity of Twitter account for various scientific organizations vs companies.

The starting assumption is that while scientists should utilize language constructs that have 0 polarity, organizations would use sentiment as means to spread their stories faster.

## Data collected

The accounts examined have a strong focus on Ecology/Biology. The data collected are their latest Tweets of about 6-9 days.
